// What is Algorithm

// The word Algorithm means "A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations" Or "A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations".

// Time Complexity - 
// How the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size n grows.
// Think of it as: "If I double the amount of data, how much longer will it take?"

// Space Complexity
// How much extra memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows.
// Think of it as: "How many sticky notes does my brain need to solve this problem?"

// What is Asymptotic Analysis
// Asymptotic Analysis is used to find which solution is good for solving the problem 


// Problem solving and logic building

// Understand Complete Problem.
// Find Solution in General Way.
// Break the Problem in parts.
// Think Coding Solution.
// Re-Analyze Solution.
// Then Write Code.
